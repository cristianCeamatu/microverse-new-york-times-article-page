              <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
                and
                a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
                the
                world of known physics.</p>

              <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                created
                in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
                hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                that
                exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
                prodigiously
                violent instant.</p>

              <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                pole
                and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in
                the
                ocean.</p>
              <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
              </p>

              <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                the
                Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

              <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
                Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                detected
                ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
                wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second
                old.
                They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
                that
                Dr. Guth was correct.

              <p>
                Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
                whether it could ever be proved.
              </p>

              <p>
                If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
                of
                dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
                space and energy to science and speculation.
              </p>

              <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
                with
                its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
                of
                other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

              <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>

              <p>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
                reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
                would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
                general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
                said,
                “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
              </p>

              <p>
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
                gravitational
                waves.”
              </p>

              <p>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
                permeates
                space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
                the
                sun.
              </p>

              <p>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
                Cosmic
                Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                Astrophysics
                here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

      <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>

      <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in
        his lifetime.</p>

      <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.” </p>

      <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing
        email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.
        Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
        that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>

      <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
        words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>

      <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known
        as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a
        Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him
        the news.</p>

      <figure class="article-video">

      </figure>

      <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>

      <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
        ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
      </p>

      <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news
        like
        this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>

      <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
        astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>

      <p>Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as
        one
        of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>

      <p>John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the
        South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very
        convincing,” he said.</p>

      <p>Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
        universes
        as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed
        reservations about inflation.</p>

      <p>Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new
        results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
        Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>

      <p>“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>

      <p>Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At
        least
        a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.</p>

      <h2>Spirals in the Sky</h2>

      <p>Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered
        accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.</p>

      <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep,
        which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry
        air
        creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of
        the
        California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>

      <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been
        there
        23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>
